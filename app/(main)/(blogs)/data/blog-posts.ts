    content: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In today's competitive job market, your resume is often the first impression you make on potential employers. With hiring managers spending an average of just 6-7 seconds reviewing each resume, it's crucial to make every word count. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essential elements of creating a resume that not only gets noticed but gets you hired.</p>

      <h2>1. Start with a Strong Summary</h2>
      <p>Your resume summary (or professional summary) is the first thing recruiters read. It should be a compelling 2-3 sentence overview that highlights your key qualifications and career objectives. Focus on what you can offer the employer, not what you're looking for.</p>

      <h3>Example of a Strong Summary:</h3>
      <blockquote>
        "Results-driven marketing professional with 5+ years of experience in digital marketing and brand strategy. Proven track record of increasing conversion rates by 40% and managing campaigns with budgets exceeding $500K. Seeking to leverage expertise in data-driven marketing to drive growth for innovative companies."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>2. Optimize for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)</h2>
      <p>Most companies use ATS software to screen resumes before they reach human eyes. To pass through these systems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use relevant keywords from the job description</li>
        <li>Stick to standard section headings (Experience, Education, Skills)</li>
        <li>Avoid graphics, tables, or unusual formatting</li>
        <li>Use standard fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Quantify Your Achievements</h2>
      <p>Instead of listing job duties, focus on quantifiable achievements. Numbers speak louder than words and give recruiters concrete evidence of your impact.</p>

      <h3>Weak Example:</h3>
      <p>"Responsible for managing social media accounts"</p>

      <h3>Strong Example:</h3>
      <p>"Increased social media engagement by 150% and grew follower base from 5K to 25K in 12 months"</p>

      <h2>4. Tailor Your Resume for Each Position</h2>
      <p>Generic resumes rarely get interviews. Take the time to customize your resume for each job application by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzing the job description for key requirements</li>
        <li>Highlighting relevant experience and skills</li>
        <li>Using industry-specific terminology</li>
        <li>Adjusting your summary to match the role</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Keep It Concise and Scannable</h2>
      <p>Your resume should be easy to scan quickly. Use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bullet points for easy reading</li>
        <li>Consistent formatting throughout</li>
        <li>White space to improve readability</li>
        <li>Action verbs to start each bullet point</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Include Relevant Skills</h2>
      <p>Create a dedicated skills section that includes both hard and soft skills relevant to your target position. Consider organizing skills into categories like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technical Skills</li>
        <li>Soft Skills</li>
        <li>Industry-Specific Skills</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Proofread and Polish</h2>
      <p>Typos and grammatical errors can immediately disqualify you. Always:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Proofread multiple times</li>
        <li>Use spell-check and grammar tools</li>
        <li>Have someone else review your resume</li>
        <li>Check for consistency in formatting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Creating a winning resume takes time and effort, but the investment pays off in more interviews and job offers. Remember that your resume is a living document that should evolve with your career. Regular updates and refinements will keep it current and effective.</p>

      <p>By following these strategies, you'll create a resume that not only passes through ATS systems but also impresses hiring managers and helps you stand out from the competition.</p>

    content: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>A well-written cover letter can be the difference between getting an interview and being passed over. While resumes focus on what you've done, cover letters explain why you're the perfect fit for the role and company.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Show your enthusiasm for the position</li>

        <li>Connect your experience to the job requirements</li>

        <li>The specific role and its requirements</li>
        <li>The hiring manager's name and background</li>

        <li>The company's competitors and industry trends</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Structure Your Cover Letter</h2>
      <p>Follow this proven format:</p>

      <h3>Opening Paragraph</h3>
      <p>Grab attention and state your interest in the position.</p>

      <h3>Body Paragraphs</h3>
      <p>Connect your experience to the job requirements with specific examples.</p>

      <h3>Closing Paragraph</h3>
      <p>Reiterate your interest and include a call to action.</p>

      <h2>Writing Tips</h2>

        <li>Start with a strong opening sentence</li>
        <li>Use specific examples and achievements</li>
        <li>Show enthusiasm and personality</li>
        <li>Keep it concise (one page maximum)</li>
        <li>Proofread carefully for errors</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>Steer clear of these pitfalls:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Focusing too much on what you want rather than what you offer</li>
        <li>Including irrelevant personal information</li>
        <li>Being too formal or too casual</li>
        <li>Repeating your resume verbatim</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Example Cover Letter</h2>
      <blockquote>
